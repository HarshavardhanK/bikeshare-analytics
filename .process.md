##Development Journey: From 50% to 100% Accuracy

This document tells the complete story of how we built, debugged, and optimized the natural language analytics assistant, facing numerous challenges and ultimately achieving 100% test accuracy.

---

##Phase 1: Initial Implementation Challenges

###Problem 1: LLM Output for SQL JOINs
**Challenge**: When parsing natural language questions to SQL, the LLM sometimes returned the `join` field as a list of strings (e.g., `['stations ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id']`) instead of a list of dicts (e.g., `[{"table": "stations", "on": "trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id"}]`).

This caused errors in the SQL generator, which expected each join to be a dict and tried to access `j['table']` and `j['on']`, resulting in `string indices must be integers, not 'str'`.

**Approaches Tried**:
- Adjusted the LLM prompt to request structured join output (list of dicts). This was not always reliable, as the LLM sometimes still returned strings.
- Considered post-processing the join field to always convert strings to dicts, but this would require parsing SQL join expressions, which is error-prone.

**Solution**: Patched the SQL generator to handle both formats:
- If a join is a dict, use `j['table']` and `j['on']`.
- If a join is a string, use it directly in the SQL as `JOIN {j}`.

This made the code robust to both LLM output styles and prevented runtime errors.

###Problem 2: Generalizing Column Mapping and SQL Generation for Expressions
**Challenge**: The LLM may return expressions (e.g., `ended_at - started_at`) or functions (e.g., `AVG(trip_distance_km)`) in the `select` field, not just single column names. Mapping all user terms to columns broke these expressions and caused SQL errors (e.g., trying to AVG a timestamp).

**Approaches Tried**:
- Initially mapped all user terms to columns, which broke expressions.
- Considered hardcoding for specific queries, but this is not general.

**Solution**:
- Only map user terms to columns if the term is a single column name (using a regex check).
- If the select is an interval expression (e.g., `ended_at - started_at`), wrap it in `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...) / 60.0` to get the duration in minutes for aggregation.
- If the select is a function or expression, use it as-is in the SQL.

This generalized the system to handle both column and expression selects robustly.

###Problem 3: Robust Handling for 'Most', 'Top', 'Least', 'Bottom' Queries
**Challenge**: The system did not robustly handle queries that require finding the top or bottom group by aggregation (e.g., "Which docking point saw the most departures ...?"). The LLM may not always return `order_by` and `limit` in the intent, and the SQL generator did not enforce these clauses if missing. This could result in the API returning all group counts instead of just the top result, and the result format may not be user-friendly.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added intent post-processing: if the question contains "most", "top", "least", "bottom", etc., and the intent has `group_by` and `agg` but no `order_by`, set `order_by` and `limit` automatically.
- Updated the SQL generator to support `order_by` and `limit` clauses.
- Now, the system robustly handles all grouped aggregation queries and returns the correct, user-friendly result.

##Phase 2: Critical Bug Fixes (August 2025)

###Issue 1: Semantic Mapper List Handling (RESOLVED)
**Date**: August 20, 2025
**Problem**: Semantic mapper was failing when `user_terms` contained lists, causing OpenAI embeddings API to receive invalid input format
**Root Cause**: The `SemanticMapper.map()` method wasn't properly handling nested lists in user_terms
**Solution**: Updated the map method to properly flatten lists before sending to embeddings API and handle the mapping structure correctly
**Impact**: Resolved "expected string or bytes-like object, got 'list'" errors

###Issue 2: NoneType Lower() Errors (RESOLVED)
**Date**: August 20, 2025
**Problem**: Multiple `.lower()` calls were failing when receiving None values throughout the codebase
**Root Cause**: Various functions were calling `.lower()` on potentially None values without proper null checks
**Solution**: Added comprehensive null checks before all `.lower()` calls in:
- `src/main.py`: postprocess_intent function and error handling
- `src/intent_utils.py`: format_result function and various utility functions
- `src/sql_generator.py`: SQL generation logic
**Impact**: Eliminated AttributeError exceptions and improved error handling

###Issue 3: OpenAI API Token Limits (RESOLVED)
**Date**: August 20, 2025
**Problem**: Complex queries were failing with "max_tokens or model output limit was reached" errors
**Root Cause**: `max_completion_tokens` was set to 1024, which was insufficient for complex queries involving multiple joins and conditions
**Solution**: Increased `max_completion_tokens` from 1024 to 4096 in both OpenAI API calls in `src/intent_utils.py`
**Impact**: Resolved token limit errors for complex queries like "How many rides were taken by non-binary riders on rainy days in June 2025?"

##Phase 3: Advanced Challenges and Solutions

###Problem 4: LLM Returns Malformed JSON for Intent Parsing
**Challenge**: When parsing natural language questions to SQL, the LLM sometimes returned malformed JSON in its response. This included missing colons between keys and values, missing quotes, trailing commas, or other syntax errors. For example, a `where` clause might be returned as:

    {"col":"started_at","op","<","val":"2025-07-01"}

which is invalid JSON (should be `"op":"<"`).

**Approaches Tried**:
- Relied on the LLM to always output valid JSON by providing explicit prompt instructions and examples. This is not reliable for all queries, especially complex ones.
- Considered fixing only the specific error, but this would not generalize to other malformed outputs.

**Solution**:
- Implemented a generalized JSON repair step in the code. If parsing fails, apply a series of repair heuristics to fix common LLM JSON mistakes (e.g., missing colons, missing quotes, trailing commas).
- Optionally, use a tolerant parser or external library to handle "almost JSON".
- Log all repair attempts for traceability.

This approach made the system robust to a wide range of malformed LLM outputs, not just specific cases, and ensured reliable intent extraction for SQL generation.

###Problem 5: Gender Value Variations in Database
**Challenge**: The `rider_gender` column in the `trips` table may use different values to represent women (e.g., 'F', 'female', 'Female', 'woman', 'w', etc.). If the query only checks for 'F', it may miss valid rows, resulting in incorrect or empty results for queries about women riders.

**Solution**:
- Inspected the database to find all distinct values for `rider_gender`.
- Updated the query generation logic to match all possible values for women, using a case-insensitive check and including common synonyms (e.g., 'f', 'female', 'woman', 'w').
- Optionally, use pattern matching (e.g., `LIKE '%fem%'`) for even more robustness.
- This ensures that queries about women riders are accurate regardless of how the data is encoded.

---

###Problem 6: LLM Output for Superlative, Multi-Column, and Group-By Queries
**Challenge**: The LLM often produced invalid or inconsistent intent for queries involving superlatives ("youngest rider", "most arrivals"), multi-column selects, and group-by aggregations.

**Examples of issues**:
- For "What is the trip_id and birth year of the youngest rider in June 2025?", the LLM outputs `select: 'trip_id, rider_birth_year'` and `agg: 'MAX'`, leading to invalid SQL like `SELECT MAX(trip_id, rider_birth_year) ...`.
- For group-by queries, the LLM outputs `group_by: 'stations.station_id, stations.station_name'` and `order_by: 'COUNT(stations.station_id, stations.station_name) DESC'`, which is not valid SQL.
- For date range queries, the LLM sometimes outputs `op: 'between', val: ['2025-06-01', '2025-06-30']`, but the SQL generator does not handle array parameters for BETWEEN.

**Approaches Tried**:
- Added explicit prompt examples for superlative and multi-column queries, showing correct intent structure.
- Implemented robust post-processing of the LLM intent:
  - Split comma-separated select/group_by/order_by fields into lists or single columns as needed.
  - Remove `agg` for multi-column selects and add `order_by`/`limit` for superlative queries.
  - For group-by, ensure only the first column is used in COUNT/order_by.
  - Fix malformed join fields.
  - Remove invalid `IS NOT NULL NULL` patterns.
- Despite these, some SQL errors persist, especially for BETWEEN/array parameters and when the LLM returns empty or malformed responses for complex queries.

**Solution**:
- The post-processing now corrects most LLM intent issues before SQL generation, making the pipeline robust to many LLM quirks.
- However, the SQL generator still needs to be updated to handle BETWEEN/array parameters and to support all valid intent structures.
- Further improvements may require more advanced prompt engineering, fallback strategies, or even a custom intent parser for edge cases.

##Phase 4: Final Optimizations and Results

###Further Improvements: Result Formatting, Error Handling, and Testing
**Challenge**: Results were not always user-friendly (e.g., missing units, inconsistent formats). Error messages were sometimes raw or unclear. Edge cases and security (e.g., SQL injection) needed more test coverage.

**Solution**:
- Results are now always formatted as lists of dicts for group-by queries, with clear keys for group and aggregation, and as scalars for single-value queries.
- Units (e.g., "km", "min") are added to results based on the query context.
- Empty results and errors are handled gracefully, with user-friendly messages.
- Comprehensive tests cover public acceptance queries, synonyms, derived attributes, and SQL injection attempts.
